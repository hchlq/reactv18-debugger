 * Simple multi-wrapper around `receiveEvent` that is intended to receive an

 *
 * This may create dispatch behavior that differs than web touch handling. We
 * loop through each of the changed touches and receive it as a single event.
 * So two `touchStart`/`touchMove`s that occur simultaneously are received as
 * two separate touch event dispatches - when they arguably should be one.
 *
 * This implementation reuses the `Touch` objects themselves as the `Event`s
 * since we dispatch an event for each touch (though that might not be spec
 * compliant). The main purpose of reusing them is to save allocations.
 *
 * TODO: Dispatch multiple changed touches in one event. The bubble path
 * could be the first common ancestor of all the `changedTouches`.
 *
 * One difference between this behavior and W3C spec: cancelled touches will
 * not appear in `.touches`, or in any future `.touches`, though they may
 * still be "actively touching the surface".
 *
 * Web desktop polyfills only need to construct a fake touch event with
 * identifier 0, also abandoning traditional click handlers.
